  As a casting director

    | password             | Frodo123*            |
    And I create a form template with title "Form for Matrix" and some form fields
      | field                     | value             |
      | title                     | Nombre y Apellido |
      | type                      | text              |
      | order                     | 0                 |
      | is_required               | True              |
    And I create a Project called "Matrix 4" with a role called "Neo"
    And I create a casting call for the project "Matrix 4" associating the role "Neo" to the form template "Form for Matrix"
      | field                     | value                      |
      | title                     | Searching Neo For Matrix 4 |
      | remuneration_type         | Remunerado |
    And I publish the casting call with an expiration date greater than the current date
    When I pause the casting call
    Then the casting call should be successfully paused
